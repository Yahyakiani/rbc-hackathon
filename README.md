## Project Approach

### Problem Statement

United Way Maritimes in Canada aims to optimize staff time to scale solutions addressing the housing crisis and poverty. The goal is to equip staff with real-time data to:

1. Identify housing gaps and needs across different geographies/demographics.
2. Identify collaboration opportunities to scale solutions.
3. Capitalize on funding opportunities.
4. Share data findings with funders, government, partners, and donors.

### Our Solution

We developed a **Digital Dashboard** comprising four main modules:

1. **United Planning**: A comprehensive planning tool to visualize housing developments, infrastructure changes, and policy amendments. Users can access detailed property attributes, including demographics, housing needs, estimated costs, and more.

2. **TownHall**: A platform for community engagement where users can express issues and vote on emerging trends, facilitating data-driven decision-making.

3. **Connect**: A collaborative space for users to work together on initiatives and mobilize funding to implement projects effectively.

4. **Resources**: A centralized repository of essential resources, including information about United Way, charity registration processes, annual reports, and other relevant documents.
